# Juspay Assignment

This project is an implementation of the provided **SaaS Dashboard designs**. It focuses on high-quality UI fidelity, smooth motion, and meaningful microinteractions for an enhanced user experience.

In this project, I used [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) for the frontend and [Shadcn UI](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) for the user interface components, and deployed the application using [Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/vercel).
